# Project 3 - ENPM 661 - Planning for Autonomous Robotics

# A_star_non_holonomic_constraints
This submission is for project 3 phase 2 part 01

Implementation of the A star Algorithm for a Point Robot with non holonomic constraints 

Required libraries - time, copy, opencv (4 and above), numpy, math and heapq


Run code a_star_project3_part01.py 


Enter the start position and goal position coordinate values as integers


Output - The final output is the video generated and saved on the system and it prints the total run time

Test case 1 - (50,50) and (550,220)
Initial head angle - 0
Clearance - 5, rpm1 - 2 and rpm2 - 4

Total time - 7s


Test case 1 - (50,50) and (550,20)
Initial head angle - 0
Clearance - 5, rpm1 - 2 and rpm2 - 4

Total time - 7.8s
